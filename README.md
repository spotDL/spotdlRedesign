## What is SpotdlRedesign<a name="what-is-spotdlredesign"></a>

Attempting to re-build spotdl to allow for user plugins so that we can deliver on a simple
out-of-the-box easy-to-use Spotify music downloader that can be customized by users to
allow for more niche functionality. Please note that this is still a work in progress.
