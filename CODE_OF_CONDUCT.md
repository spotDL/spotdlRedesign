# Code of conduct

<!-- mdformat-toc start --slug=github --maxlevel=6 --minlevel=2 -->

<!-- mdformat-toc end -->

1. Be Nice

2. Don't be an ass

3. Go the extra mile to sound nice because people are generally biased towards
   interpreting your message negatively
   ([Negativity bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negativity_bias))

4. Focus on the issue at hand, not the people involved

5. Don't use expletives (no, not even for emphasis). Yes, words like 'ass', 'crap',
   'shitty'... are considered expletives

6. Talk only if you have something meaningful to add

7. Stay on topic in Issues/PRs/Discussion-threads

8. Don't leave Issues/PRs/Discussions hanging, be available to answer questions and
   provide details to the maintainers

9. Close Issues once your done with them
